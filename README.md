# Welcome to the journey of Learning GO

## History of Go

Go is a stratergy chess game originated in China. It uses a grid-shaped board and black & white chesses. According to legend, Go was invented by Emperor Yao more than 4,000 years ago. Since His son Danzhu was very self-satisfied, Emperor Yao invented Go to cultivate his son's character.
