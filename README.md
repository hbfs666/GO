## How to win a GO match 

There are two types of chess in GO - black and white. It is stipulated that the black side shall go first, then the two players will alternately place black and white pieces at the intersections of the chessboard grid of nineteen by nineteen lines. After the move is completed, you cannot regret the move. In the course of the game, you encircle the ground and "eat" the opponent's chess. The victory or defeat is determined by how much land you surrounded.
